- [ ] Take matrices at 20% / 30% etc...
- [ ] Make difference matrices SCI - AD for instance, to find interesting regions.
- [ ] Interp: do not use all electrodes.
- [ ] Plots with red blue contrast is better.
- [ ] Visualiser pour pouvoir dire on prend alpha 20% graph, beta 40% region on electrode 4, 5, et 1.
- [ ] PCA to keep 90% of the information, KMEANS multi dim, silhouette, ARI more interesting
- [ ] Multi classe -> show performances class by class
